Plays a crucial role in maintaining vision, promoting immune function, and supporting skin health. 

Deficiency in Vitamin A, particularly common in developing regions, can have significant impacts on health.The most critical characteristics of Vitamin A deficiency include:

Impaired Vision: One of the most notable consequences of Vitamin A deficiency is night blindness (nyctalopia). Severe deficiency can lead to xerophthalmia, a condition that can result in corneal ulcers, scarring, and ultimately blindness if untreated.

Weakened Immune Response: Vitamin A is essential for maintaining epithelial tissues and mucosal barriers, which protect the body from infections. Deficiency can lead to a weakened immune response, making individuals more susceptible to infectious diseases like measles and respiratory infections.

Skin Health Issues: A deficiency in Vitamin A can result in dry, rough skin (hyperkeratosis) due to the inability of skin cells to differentiate properly.

These components highlight the systemic importance of Vitamin A and the far-reaching impacts of its deficiency, necessitating proper dietary intake and supplementation in vulnerable populations.
