Ensure Adequate Dietary Intake: Include vitamin K-rich foods in your diet, 
such as leafy greens (spinach, kale, broccoli), as well as other sources 
like liver, meat, eggs, and fermented foods.

Newborn Care: Administer a vitamin K injection to newborns, as 
they are at high risk for deficiency due to low stores at birth and lack of 
intestinal bacteria to produce vitamin K.

Monitor Gut Health: If you have conditions like celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, 
or other malabsorption issues, regularly consult a doctor to ensure proper vitamin absorption.

Be Cautious with Medications: If you’re taking blood thinners like warfarin, avoid 
large fluctuations in vitamin K intake, as it may interfere with medication effectiveness. 
Consult a healthcare provider to maintain a balance.

Supplementation if Necessary: In cases of inadequate intake or malabsorption,
 vitamin K supplements may be needed, but they should be taken under medical supervision.

Maintaining a consistent intake of vitamin K and addressing factors that may hinder its absorption 
can help prevent deficiency-related issues.
