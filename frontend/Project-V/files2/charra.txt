Deficiency occurs when the body lacks adequate amounts of vitamin B

Vitamin B deficiency occurs when the body lacks adequate amounts of one or more of the eight 
essential B vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B9, and B12). Each B vitamin plays a distinct role in 
maintaining overall health, and a deficiency in any of these can lead to various health issues. 
The most common causes and symptoms related to Vitamin B deficiencies include:

Inadequate Dietary Intake: Diets lacking in B vitamin-rich foods, such as whole grains, meat, eggs, 
dairy products, and leafy greens, can lead to deficiencies.

Malabsorption: Certain medical conditions, such as celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, or alcoholism, 
can impair the body’s ability to absorb B vitamins from food.

Key Vitamin B Deficiencies and Symptoms:
Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): Deficiency can lead to beriberi, which affects the cardiovascular and nervous systems, 
causing weakness, fatigue, and heart issues.

Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): Deficiency results in ariboflavinosis, leading to sore throat, cracked lips,
 inflammation of the mouth, and skin disorders.

Vitamin B3 (Niacin): Severe deficiency can cause pellagra, characterized by dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia.

Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid): Rarely leads to deficiency but can cause symptoms like fatigue, irritability, and numbness.

Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine): Deficiency may result in anemia, depression, confusion, and a weakened immune system.

Vitamin B7 (Biotin): Deficiency can cause hair thinning, skin rashes, and neurological issues.

Vitamin B9 (Folate): Deficiency can lead to megaloblastic anemia and in pregnant women, it increases 
the risk of birth defects, particularly neural tube defects.

Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin): A deficiency can cause pernicious anemia, nerve damage,
 fatigue, and memory loss, particularly in older adults and vegetarians.
