Vitamin K


Deficiency occurs when the body lacks adequate amounts of vitamin K, a nutrient essential for blood clotting and
bone health. Deficiency can arise due to several factors:

Inadequate Dietary Intake: Vitamin K is found in green leafy vegetables, meats, and dairy products.
 A diet low in these foods can lead to deficiency over time.

Malabsorption Disorders: Conditions like celiac disease, Crohn's disease, or cystic fibrosis impair the body's 
ability to absorb fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin K from the intestines.

Liver Disorders: Since the liver plays a role in producing clotting factors dependent on vitamin K, 
diseases like cirrhosis or hepatitis can interfere with vitamin K utilization, leading to deficiency.

Use of Certain Medications: Long-term use of antibiotics can reduce gut bacteria that produce vitamin K, 
and blood thinners like warfarin can interfere with vitamin K's role in clotting, sometimes leading 
to a relative deficiency.

Newborn Infants: Infants are at risk for vitamin K deficiency because they have low stores at birth 
and their intestines are sterile, lacking the bacteria that help produce vitamin K. This is why newborns are
often given a vitamin K injection shortly after birth.

Vitamin K deficiency can lead to bleeding disorders and weakened bones if not addressed.
